# -Automated-Detection-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-
his project aims to develop an automated, deep learning-based system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and classify diabetic retinopathy stages from retinal fundus images. By leveraging CNNâ€™s powerful feature extraction capabilities, the model can learn to identify thereby eliminating the need for manual feature engineering.
